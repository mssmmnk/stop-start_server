# stop-start_server
This is a small project to automate stopping and starting servers using the paramiko library. 
It's common for me to have to access multiple servers to stop and restart them within deployments processes and the task of opening unique terminals for each server was bothering me.
So I created this little script that does this task while I can enjoy the sun through the window. 
Project steps :
1-assessment of necessary tools
2-structuring of code steps
3-research and writing the script
4-tests
(these steps were not linear)
